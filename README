NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::Session::AsObject - Make your session data an object

SYNOPSIS
        package MyApp;

        use MyApp::Session;

        use Catalyst qw( Session
                         Session::AsObject
                         Session::Store::DBI
                         Session::State::Cookie
                       );

        __PACKAGE__->config
            ( session => { ...,
                           object_class => 'MyApp::Session',
                         },
            );

        sub foo : Global
        {
            my $self = shift;
            my $c    = shift;

            my $session = $c->session_object();

            if ( $session->has_error_messages() ) { ... }
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This class makes it easier to treat the session as an object rather than
    a plain hash reference. This is useful if you want to ensure that the
    session only contains specific pieces of data.

    However, because of implementation details, we cannot override the
    existing `$c->session()' method, so you need to use the new
    `$c->session_object()' method provided by this plugin.

METHODS
    This class provides the following methods:

  $c->session_object()
    Returns the object stored in the session. If needed, a new object is
    created.

  $c->has_session_object()
    Returns true if there is an object already in the session.

CONFIG
    This plugin has only configuration key, "object_class". This key should
    appear under the existing top-level "session" configuration key.

    The "object_class" must already be loaded, and must have a `new()'
    method as its constructor. This constructor must not require any
    parameters, as it will be called without any arguments.

BUGS
    Please report any bugs or feature requests to
    `bug-catalyst-plugin-sessionasobject@rt.cpan.org', or through the web
    interface at http://rt.cpan.org. I will be notified, and then you'll
    automatically be notified of progress on your bug as I make changes.

DONATIONS
    If you'd like to thank me for the work I've done on this module, please
    consider making a "donation" to me via PayPal. I spend a lot of free
    time creating free software, and would appreciate any support you'd care
    to offer.

    Please note that I am not suggesting that you must do this in order for
    me to continue working on this particular software. I will continue to
    do so, inasmuch as I have in the past, for as long as it interests me.

    Similarly, a donation made in this way will probably not make me work on
    this software much more, unless I get so many donations that I can
    consider working on free software full time, which seems unlikely at
    best.

    To donate, log into PayPal and send money to autarch@urth.org or use the
